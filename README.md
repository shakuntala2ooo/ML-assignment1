# ML-assignment1

i have used a dataset from internet for this project. The steps ive folloed are


Loaded the dataset, Handled missing data if there's any missing.
Ccecked the null values,made the heat map,
dropped the null values,
transformed the data, getting an minute, hour, day and month from the data of the trip.
Extracted relevant features such as time of day, day of the week, holidays, weather, and any spatial attributes.
considered various models, including regression models, XGBoost, ARIMA, and deep neural networks (DNN).
Trained each model on the training data and evaluate them using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Square Error, etc.).
Implemented separate models or routing mechanism as needed
checked histogram for miles, how many people prefer long and how many people prefer short trips
then made a model for trip per minute of an hour, per hour of the day, per day of the month,
then checked the starting point of the trip.
